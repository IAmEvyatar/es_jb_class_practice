<body>
    Relative linking will look for the hyper text reference location in relation to the file the link is on.
    
    <a href="Relative/004.1.html#Here">004.1.html is a relative link. which is down a folder</a>
    An absoloute link will always go to the same adress regardless of current file location in folder tree.
    <a href="https://www.google.com">This is an absoloute link.</a>
