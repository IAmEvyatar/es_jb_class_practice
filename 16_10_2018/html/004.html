    <p>CSS comes in 3 forms: inline, a style tag in the head section and in a seperated file.</p>
    <p>css is used for styling and paginating our hyper text mark up</p>
    <p>css works with a selector and a declaration block which consists of rulesets that are made out from properties and values.</p>
    <p>in this sheet, we are using style in the head section, check the source code to see how it works.</p>
